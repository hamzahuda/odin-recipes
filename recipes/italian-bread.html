  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>For a loaf of crusty Italian bread, try this bread recipe. The dough is made in a bread machine, then the loaves
    are baked in the oven.</p>
  <br>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 ⅓ cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons olive oil</li>
    <li>4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons cornmeal</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place 1 1/3 cups warm water, olive oil, flour, brown sugar, salt, and yeast into a bread machine in the order
      listed, or
      follow the order recommended by your manufacturer if different. Run the Dough cycle, about 90 minutes.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle cornmeal onto a cutting board. Punch down dough, turn out onto a lightly floured surface, and form into
      two
      loaves. Place loaves, seam-side down, onto the cutting board; cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled
      in
      volume, about 40 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Beat egg and 1 tablespoon water together in a small bowl; brush over risen loaves.</li>
    <li>Use a sharp knife to quickly cut one long slash down the center of each loaf. Gently shake the cutting board to
      make
      sure the loaves are not sticking; use a spatula or pastry knife to loosen them if necessary. Slide loaves onto a
      baking
      sheet with a quick but careful motion.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom, 30 to 35
      minutes.</li>
  </ol>
