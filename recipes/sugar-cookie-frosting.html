  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Every baker needs a good sugar cookie frosting in their repertoire. This simple, top-rated sugar cookie frosting
    recipe
    will quickly become your new go-to!</p>
  <br>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shortening: This sugar cookie frosting starts with shortening instead of butter. Why? Shortening creates
      frosting that
      firms up nicely and is unlikely to melt, which means it's perfect for stacking cookies.</li>
    <li>Confectioners' sugar: Confectioners' sugar (a.k.a. powdered sugar or icing sugar) is the next ingredient. Don't
      substitute granulated sugar, as it's not fine enough.</li>
    <li>Milk: A few tablespoons of milk thins the frosting, making it perfectly spreadable.</li>
    <li>Vanilla: A teaspoon of vanilla extract enhances the flavor of the sugar cookie frosting. You can substitute
      almond
      extract, if desired.</li>
    <li>Food coloring (optional): If you need your frosting to be a specific color, use food coloring to create the
      perfect hue.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Beat the shortening until creamy.</li>
    <li>Gradually beat in the sugar and milk in small amounts, alternating until smooth.</li>
    <li>Add vanilla and continue beating until the frosting is stiff and glossy.</li>
    <li>Stir in the food coloring, if desired.</li>
  </ol>
